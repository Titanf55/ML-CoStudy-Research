## About
**Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning Model**

## Objective
- **Data preprocessing**: Handled numerical and categorical weather features from a CSV dataset, applied scaling, and managed missing values.
- **Model development**: Implemented a classification model with feature selection and label encoding for categorical data.
- **Model evaluation**: Assessed predictions with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,
   The evaluation also involved identifying misclassifications, such as predicting "no rain" when the correct output was "Sunny."
- **Best accuracy**: The best accuracy of 91.23% was achieved using the **CatBoost technique**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
